# ML-model-bagging-regressor
I learned the concept of the bagging regressor and how to use it. Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, is particularly useful for reducing the variance and improving the accuracy of regression models. By training multiple instances of the same regression model on different subsets of the training data, which are created through random sampling with replacement, bagging creates a diverse set of models. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions from all the model instances. This technique is especially effective for high-variance models, like decision trees, as it enhances stability and reduces the risk of overfitting by capturing a wider range of patterns in the data.
